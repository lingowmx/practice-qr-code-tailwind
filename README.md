## My process
First i tried to use the new version of tailwind v4 but it was complicated and i didnt was able to fix the erros so i moved back to one version before.
I started using some back memories of how to organize my html bse is been a wild since i did somethiing like this.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind v3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Im practicing this simple projects but instead of using normal css try to work with tailwind and get use to the different names.
I realized that the sm: should be used thinking that im already doing a desktop or bigger than 375px. So i understood why there's one process called mobile first.
